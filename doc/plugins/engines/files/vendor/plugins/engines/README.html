      <h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
This document gives an overview of how the <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> mechanism works within
a Rails environment. In most cases the code below is just an example. For
more information or documentation, please go to <a
href="http://rails-engines.org">rails-engines.org</a>.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Rails <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> are a way of
dropping in whole chunks of functionality into your existing application
without affecting <b>any</b> of your existing code. The could also be
described as mini-applications, or vertical application slices -
top-to-bottom units which provide full MVC coverage for a certain, specific
application function.
</p>
<p>
As an example, the Login <a
href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> provides a full user
login subsystem, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>controllers to manage user accounts;

</li>
<li>helpers for you to interact with account information from other parts of
your application;

</li>
<li>the model objects and schemas to create the required tables;

</li>
<li>stylesheets and javascript files to enhance the views;

</li>
<li>and any other library files required.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once the Rails Core team decides on a suitable method for packaging
plugins, <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> can be
distributed using the same mechanisms. If you are developing engines
yourself for use across multiple projects, linking them as svn externals
allows seamless updating of bugfixes across multiple applications.
</p>
<h1>Edge <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a></h1>
<p>
If you are using Edge Rails (an SVN copy of Rails, rather than an
&#8216;official&#8217; release), there are several MASSIVELY IMPORTANT
issues that you need to bear in mind.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, you are using an unstable version of Rails, so it is possible that
things will break. We work hard to keep the <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> plugin up to speed with
the changes in Rails at the bleeding edge, but sometimes significant parts
of Rails change it WILL cause problems. This is the price of using the
bleeding edge. Since edge is synonymous for unstable, the version of the <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> plugin which is
compatible with Edge Rails is kept separate from the official release.
Please ensure that you have used SVN to get your engines plugin from
</p>
<pre>
  http://svn.rails-engines.org/engines/trunk
</pre>
<p>
The normal &#8216;script/plugin install engines&#8217; will NOT get you
this version.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, you NEED to tell the engines plugin if you expect it to perform
with Edge behaviour. This is done by adding the following lines at the
*very top* of environment.rb (yes, the VERY TOP)
</p>
<pre>
  module Engines
    CONFIG = {:edge =&gt; true}
  end
</pre>
<p>
This will set the plugin to work with Edge Rails, rather than expecting an
official release.
</p>
<p>
If you are having problems, please try and contribute a bug report if you
can so we can improve the plugin and keep up to speed with Rails&#8217;
bleeding edge. Your input is *absolutely crucial* to this. If you&#8217;re
not comfortable with tracking down bugs in Rails&#8217; and <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a>&#8217; internal code,
there is a test application available at
</p>
<pre>
  http://svn.rails-engines.org/applications/engines_test
</pre>
<p>
which contains an array of tests that might help you (and us) pinpoint
where the issue is. Please download this application and consult the README
for more information.
</p>
<p>
Finally, please don&#8217;t forget about our website and mailing lists.

<h1>Using the <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> plugin itself</h1>
<p>
There are a number of features of the <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> plugin itself which may
be useful to know:
</p>
<h3><a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000053">Engines.log</a></h3>
<p>
The <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> plugin comes
with its own logger, which is invaluable when debugging. To use it, simply
call
</p>
<pre>
  Engines.create_logger
</pre>
<p>
Two optional arguments may be passed to this method:
</p>
<pre>
  Engines.create_logger(&lt;io&gt;)
</pre>
<p>
Would set the outputter to the logger to the given IO object &lt;io&gt;.
For example, this could be STDERR or STDOUT (the default). The second
argument is the logger level:
</p>
<pre>
  Engines.create_logger(STDOUT, Logger::INFO)
</pre>
<p>
The logger can be accessed using either of the following:
</p>
<pre>
  Engines.log.[debug|info|whatever] &quot;message&quot;
  Engines.logger.[debug|info|whatever] &quot;message&quot;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230; essentially it&#8217;s a Logger object. It&#8217;s worth noting
that if you *don&#8217;t* create a logger, calls to <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000053">Engines.log</a> will just
be swallowed without a sound, making it very very easy to completely
silence <a href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> logging.
</p>
<h3>Engines.config(:root)</h3>
<p>
By default, the <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a>
plugin expects to be starting <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> from within
RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins. However, if you&#8217;d like to store your
engines in a different directory, add the following line <b>before</b> any
call to <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000054">Engines.start</a>
</p>
<pre>
  Engines.config(:root, &quot;/path/to/your/directory&quot;, :force)
</pre>
<h3>Rake Tasks</h3>
<p>
The engines plugin comes with a number of handy rake tasks:
</p>
<pre>
  #Â display version information about the engines subsystem
  rake engines:info

  # migrate engines' database schemas in a controlled way
  rake db:migrate:engines

  # generates full documentation for all engines
  rake doc:engines
</pre>
<p>
There are more, but you&#8217;ll have to discover them yourself&#8230;
</p>
<h2>More information</h2>
<p>
For more information about what you can do with the <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> plugin, you&#8217;ll
need to generate the documentation (rake plugindoc), or go to <a
href="http://rails-engines.org">rails-engines.org</a>. Good luck!
</p>
<h1>Quickstart</h1>
<h3>Gentlemen, Start your <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a>!</h3>
<p>
Here&#8217;s an <b>example</b> of how you might go about using Rails <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a>. Please bear in mind
that actual <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> may
differ from this, but these are the steps you will <b>typically</b> have to
take. Refer to individual <a
href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> documentation for
specific installation instructions. Anyway, on with the show:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the Rails <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a>
plugin into your plugins directory. You&#8216;ll probably need to accept
the SSL certificate here for the OpenSVN servers. For example:

<pre>
 $ script/plugin install engines

 or

    $ svn co http://svn.rails-engines.org/plugins/engines &lt;MY_RAILS_APP&gt;/vendor/plugins/engines
</pre>
</li>
<li>Install your engine into the plugins directory in a similar way.

</li>
<li>Create the RDoc for the engines plugin and for your engines so you know
what&#8217;s going on:

<pre>
  $ rake doc:plugins
  $ rake doc:engines
</pre>
</li>
<li>Initialize any database schema provided. The <a
href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> may provide Rake tasks to
do this for you. Beware that accepting an <a
href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> schema might affect any
existing database tables you have installed! You are STRONGLY recommended
to inspect the <tt>db/schema.rb</tt> file to see exactly what running it
might change.

</li>
<li>Add configuration to <tt>environment.rb</tt>: e.g.

<pre>
   # Add your application configuration here
   module MyEngine
     config :top_speed, &quot;MegaTurboFast&quot;
   end

   Engines.start :my_engine
</pre>
</li>
<li>Run your server!

<pre>
   $ script/server
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Building an <a href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a></h1>
<p>
Here&#8217;s a sample rails application with a detailed listing of an
example engines as a concrete example:
</p>
<pre>
  RAILS_ROOT
    |- app
    |- lib
    |- config
    |- &lt;... other directories ...&gt;
    |- vendor
        |-plugins
            |- engines               &lt;-- the engines plugin
            |- some_other_plugin
            |- my_engine             &lt;-- our example engine
                  |- init_engine.rb
                  |- app
                  |     |- controllers
                  |     |- model
                  |     |- helpers
                  |     |- views
                  |- db
                  |- tasks
                  |- lib
                  |- public
                  |     |- javascripts
                  |     |- stylesheets
                  |- test
</pre>
<p>
The internal structure of an engine mirrors the familiar core of a Rails
application, with most of the engine within the <tt>app</tt> subdirectory.
Within <tt>app</tt>, the controllers, views and model objects behave just
as you might expect if there in the top-level <tt>app</tt> directory.
</p>
<p>
When you call <tt><a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000054">Engines.start</a>
:my_engine</tt> in <tt>environment.rb</tt> a few important bits of black
magic voodoo happen:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the engine&#8217;s controllers, views and models are mixed in to your
running Rails application;

</li>
<li>files in the <tt>lib</tt> directory of your engine (and subdirectories) are
made available to the rest of your system

</li>
<li>any directory structure in the folder <tt>public/</tt> within your engine
is made available to the webserver

</li>
<li>the file <tt>init_engine.rb</tt> is loaded from within the engine - just
like a plugin. The reason why engines need an init_engine.rb rather than an
init.rb is because Rails&#8217; default plugin system might try and load an
engine before the <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a>
plugin has been loaded, resulting in all manner of badness. Instead,
Rails&#8217; skips over any engine plugins, and the <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> plugin handles
initializing your <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a>
plugins when you &#8216;start&#8217; each engine.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
From within <tt>init_engine.rb</tt> you should load any libraries from your
<tt>lib</tt> directory that your engine might need to function. You can
also perform any configuration required.
</p>
<h3>Loading all <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a></h3>
<p>
Calling either <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000054">Engines.start</a> (with no
arguments) or <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000055">Engines.start_all</a> will
load all engines available. Please note that your plugin can only be
<b>automatically</b> detected as an engine by the presence of an
&#8216;init_engine.rb&#8217; file, or if the engine is in a directory named
&lt;something&gt;_engine, or &lt;something&gt;_bundle. If neither of these
conditions hold, then your engine will not be loaded by <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000054">Engines.start</a>() (with
no arguments) or <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000055">Engines.start_all</a>().
</p>
<h1>Configuring <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a></h1>
<p>
Often your engine will require a number of configuration parameters set,
some of which should be alterable by the user to reflect their particular
needs. For example, a Login System might need a unique Salt value set to
encrypt user passwords. This value should be unique to each application.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> provides a simple
mechanism to handle this, and it&#8217;s already been hinted at above.
Within any module, a new method is now available: <tt>config</tt>. This
method creates a special <tt>CONFIG</tt> Hash object within the <a
href="../../../../classes/Module.html">Module</a> it is called, and can be
used to store your parameters. For a user to set these parameters, they
should reopen the module (before the corresponding <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html#M000054">Engines.start</a> call), as
follows:
</p>
<pre>
  module MyModule
    config :some_option, &quot;really_important_value&quot;
  end
  Engines.start :my_engine
</pre>
<p>
Because this config value has been set before the <a
href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> is started, subsequent
attempts to set this config value will be ignored and the user-specified
value used instead. Of course, there are situations where you <b>really</b>
want to set the config value, even if it already exists. In such cases the
config call can be changed to:
</p>
<pre>
  config :some_option, &quot;no_THIS_really_important_value&quot;, :force
</pre>
<p>
The additional parameter will force the new value to be used. For more
information, see <a
href="../../../../classes/Module.html#M000016">Module#config</a>.
</p>
<h1>Tweaking <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a></h1>
<p>
One of the best things about <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> is that if you
don&#8217;t like the default behaviour of any component, you can override
it without needing to overhaul the whole engine. This makes adding your
customisations to engines almost painless, and allows for
upgrading/updating engine code without affecting the specialisations you
need for your particular application.
</p>
<h3>View Tweaks</h3>
<p>
These are the simplest - just drop your customised view (or partial) into
you <tt>/app/views</tt> directory in the corresponding location for the
engine, and your view will be used in preference to the engine view. For
example, if we have a ItemController with an action &#8216;show&#8217;, it
will (normally) expect to find its view as <tt>report/show.rhtml</tt> in
the <tt>views</tt> directory. The view is found in the engine at
<tt>/vendor/engines/my_engine/app/views/report/show.rhtml</tt>. However, if
you create the file <tt>/app/views/report/show.rhtml</tt>, that file will
be used instead! The same goes for partials.
</p>
<h3>Controller Tweaks</h3>
<p>
You can override controller behaviour by replacing individual controller
methods with your custom behaviour. Lets say that our
ItemController&#8217;s &#8216;show&#8217; method isn&#8217;t up to scratch,
but the rest of it behaves just fine. To override the single method, create
<tt>/app/controllers/item_controller.rb</tt>, just as if it were going to
be a new controller in a regular Rails application. then, implement your
show method as you would like it to happen.
</p>
<p>
&#8230; and that&#8217;s it. Your custom code will be mixed in to the
engine controller, replacing its old method with your custom code.
</p>
<h3>Model/Lib Tweaks</h3>
<p>
Alas, tweaking model objects isn&#8217;t quite so easy (yet). If you need
to change the behaviour of model objects, you&#8217;ll need to copy the
model file from the engine into <tt>/app/models</tt> and edit the methods
yourself. Library code can be overridden in a similar way.
</p>
<h1>Public Files</h1>
<p>
If the <a href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> includes a
<tt>public</tt> directory, its contents will be mirrored into
<tt>RAILS_ROOT/public/engine_files/&amp;lt;engine_name&amp;gt;/</tt> so
that these files can be served by your webserver to browsers and users over
the internet.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> also provides two
convenience methods for loading stylesheets and javascript files in your
layouts: <tt>engine_stylesheet</tt> and <tt>engine_javascript</tt>.
</p>
<h3><a href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> Stylesheets</h3>
<pre>
  &lt;%= engine_stylesheet &quot;my_engine&quot; %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
will include
<tt>RAILS_ROOT/public/&amp;lt;engine_files&amp;gt;/my_engine/stylesheets/my_engine.css</tt>
in your layout. If you have more than one stylesheet, you can include them
in the same call:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= engine_stylesheet &quot;my_engine&quot;, &quot;stylesheet_2&quot;, &quot;another_one&quot; %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
will give you:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;link href=&quot;/engine_files/my_engine/stylesheets/my_engine.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot; rel=&quot;Stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;/engine_files/my_engine/stylesheets/stylesheet_2.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot; rel=&quot;Stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;link href=&quot;/engine_files/my_engine/stylesheets/another_one.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot; rel=&quot;Stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
in your rendered layout.
</p>
<h3><a href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> Javascripts</h3>
<p>
The <tt>engine_javascript</tt> command works in exactly the same way as
above.
</p>
<h1>Databases and <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a></h1>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> schema information can
be handled using similar mechanisms to your normal application schemas.
</p>
<h2>CAVEAT EMPTOR!</h2>
<p>
I.E. Big Huge Warning In Flashing Lights.
</p>
<p>
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bear in mind that if you are letting someone ELSE
have a say in what tables you are using, you&#8217;re basically opening
your application schema open to potential HAVOC. I cannot stress how
serious this is. It is YOUR responsibility to ensure that you trust the
schema and migration information, and that it&#8217;s not going to drop
your whole database. You need to inspect these things. YOU do. If you run
these voodoo commands and your database essplodes because you didn&#8217;t
double double double check what was going on, your embarassment will be
infinite. And your project will be skroo&#8217;d if the migration is
irreversible.
</p>
<p>
That said, if you are working in a team and you all trust each other, which
is hopefully true, this can be quite useful.
</p>
<h2>Migrating <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a></h2>
<p>
To migrate all engines to the latest version:
</p>
<pre>
 rake db:migrate:engines
</pre>
<p>
To migrate a single engine, for example the login engine:
</p>
<pre>
 rake db:migrate:engines ENGINE=login  (or login_engine)
</pre>
<p>
To migrate a single engine to a specific revision:
</p>
<pre>
 rake db:migrate:engines ENGINE=login VERSION=4
</pre>
<p>
This:
</p>
<pre>
 rake db:migrate:engines VERSION=1
</pre>
<p>
&#8230; will not work, because we felt it was too dangerous to allow ALL
engines to be migrated to a specific version, since such versions might be
incompatible.
</p>
<h1>Testing <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a></h1>
<p>
The <a href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> plugin comes
with mechanisms to help test <a
href="../../../../classes/Engines.html">Engines</a> within a
developer&#8217;s own application. The testing extensions enable developers
to load fixtures into specific tables irrespective of the name of the
fixtures file. This work is heavily based on patches made by Duane Johnson
(canadaduane), viewable at <a
href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/1911">dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/1911</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/Engine.html">Engine</a> developers should
supply fixture files in the &lt;engine&gt;/test/fixtures directory as
normal. Within their tests, they should load the fixtures using the
&#8216;fixture&#8217; command (rather than the normal
&#8216;fixtures&#8217; command). For example:
</p>
<pre>
  class UserTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
    fixture :users, :table_name =&gt; LoginEngine.config(:user_table), :class_name =&gt; &quot;User&quot;

    ...
</pre>
<p>
This will ensure that the fixtures/users.yml file will get loaded into the
correct table, and will use the correct model object class.
</p>
<p>
Your engine should provide a test_helper.rb file in &lt;engine&gt;/test,
the contents of which should include the following:
</p>
<pre>
  # Load the default rails test helper - this will load the environment.
        require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../../../../test/test_helper'

        # ensure that the Engines testing enhancements are loaded and will override Rails own
        # code where needed. This line is very important!
        require File.join(Engines.config(:root), &quot;engines&quot;, &quot;lib&quot;, &quot;testing_extensions&quot;)

        # Load the schema - if migrations have been performed, this will be up to date.
        load(File.dirname(__FILE__) + &quot;/../db/schema.rb&quot;)

        # set up the fixtures location to use your engine's fixtures
        Test::Unit::TestCase.fixture_path = File.dirname(__FILE__)  + &quot;/fixtures/&quot;
        $LOAD_PATH.unshift(Test::Unit::TestCase.fixture_path)
</pre>
<h2>Loading <a href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a></h2>
<p>
An additional helpful task for loading fixture data is also provided
(thanks to Joe Van Dyk):
</p>
<pre>
  rake db:fixtures:engines:load
  rake db:fixtures:engines:load PLUGIN=login_engine
</pre>
<p>
will load the engine fixture data into your development database.
</p>
<h3>Important Caveat</h3>
<p>
Unlike the new &#8216;fixture&#8217; directive described above, this task
currently relies on you ensuring that the table name to load fixtures into
is the same as the name of the fixtures file you are trying to load. If you
are using defaults, this should be fine. If you have changed table names,
you will need to rename your fixtures files (and possibly update your tests
to reflect this too).
</p>
<p>
You should also note that fixtures typically tend to depend on test
configuration information (such as test salt values), so not all data will
be usable in fixture form.
