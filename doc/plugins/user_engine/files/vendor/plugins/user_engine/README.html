      <h1><a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a>: Login + Roles</h1>
<p>
The <a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a> extends
the LoginEngine with a very, <b>very</b> simple implementation of RBAC -
role based access control. As well as the &#8216;User&#8217; object, the <a
href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a> provides
Permission objects, and Role objects. Each User can have many Roles, and
each Role is associated with many Permissions. A Permission is simple a
controller/action pair. A Role which is associated with some permission has
access to that specific controller/action, i.e. any Role associated with
the Permission object &quot;user/home&quot; will be allowed to call that
action.
</p>
<h3>Not the One True RBAC system</h3>
<p>
I&#8217;ll make this point at the beginning, so there can be no doubt -
this is <b>not</b> a full permission system. The <a
href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a> only controls
which users have the right to hit which controller/action pairs. It will
not control access to data at all, so for instance you cannot use it to
give users the ability to edit only a subset of your data object (unless
that subset is controlled via different controller actions).
</p>
<h1>Installing</h1>
<ol>
<li>Create your Rails application, set up your databases, grab the Engines
plugin and the LoginEngine, and install them.

</li>
<li>Install the <a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a>
into your vendor/plugins directory

</li>
<li>Modify your Engines.start call in config/environment.rb - if you have
specifically specified which Engines to start, ensure that you add :user
(or :user_engine). The important point here is to note that the <a
href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a> must be started
<b>after</b> the LoginEngine, since it will override a small amount of the
behaviour in the latter. The end of your environment.rb file should look
something like this:

<pre>
 Engines.start :login, :user

  or

    Engines.start :login
    Engines.start :user

  or simply:

    Engines.start # note that this use assumes that you haven't renamed the user_engine
                  # to anything which would come before 'login_engine' alphabetically
</pre>
</li>
<li>Edit your application.rb file so it looks something like the following
(note the new <tt>include <a
href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a></tt> and the
changed <tt>before_filter</tt>):

<pre>
 class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
   include LoginEngine
   include UserEngine

   helper :user
   model :user

   before_filter :authorize_action
 end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Edit your application_helper.rb file:

<pre>
 module ApplicationHelper
   include LoginEngine
   include UserEngine
 end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Perform any configuration you might need. You&#8216;ll probably want to set
these values in environment.rb (before the call to Engines.start):

<pre>
 module UserEngine
   config :admin_login, &quot;the login name for your administrator user&quot;
   config :admin_email, &quot;an email address for your administrator&quot;
   config :admin_password, &quot;your initial admin password&quot;
 end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Initialize the database tables. You must ensure that the tables for the
LoginEngine are present since this engine builds on top of them. You will
probably get a warning if this is your first installation of the User
Engine, indicating that you don&#8217;t have an Admin role - that&#8217;s
fine, we&#8217;ll be creating it later. You can either use the engine
migrations by calling:

<pre>
 rake engine_migrate

  to move all engines to their latest versions, or

    rake engine_migrate ENGINE=user

  to migrate only this engine. Alternatively, if you just want to load the full schema information for the User and LoginEngines, run

    rake import_user_engine_schema
</pre>
</li>
<li>Run the rake task to install the default Roles and administrator user. This
will also create a new user with the Admin role - the default login (if you
didn&#8217;t set it in step 6) is &#8216;admin&#8217; and the password is
&#8216;testing&#8217;. Make sure you change it!:

<pre>
 rake bootstrap
</pre>
</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a> includes a
method to check whether or not the system roles created above are still
intact. You should typically call this each time the server starts, by
placing the following call at the bottom of your environment.rb:

<pre>
 UserEngine.check_system_roles
</pre>
</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a> provides a
default stylesheet and a small javascript helper file (used in the
Role#edit action), so you&#8217;ll probably want to include the former and
almost certainly the latter in your application&#8217;s layout. Add the
following lines:

<pre>
  &lt;%= engine_stylesheet &quot;user_engine&quot; %&gt;
  &lt;%= engine_javascript &quot;user_engine&quot; %&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Remove any existing sessions (since they might interfere with the login
process), and start the server and log using your administrator login and
password (if you didn&#8217;t set one explicitly in your configuration, the
defaults are &#8216;admin&#8217;/&#8217;testing&#8217; - make sure you
change them!) and go to <a
href="http://localhost:3000/user/list">localhost:3000/user/list</a> to see
a list of all the users. From there you can create new users, view roles
&amp; permissions, and play around&#8230;

</li>
<li>Since the <a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a>
overrides some of the default behaviour in the LoginEngine, if you have
made your own modifications within your app directory, you&#8217;ll
probably want to examine these changes to make sure that your own
customisations will still operate as expected. You&#8216;ll need to look at
the following:

</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a>&#8217;s
models/user.rb model will override the default given in LoginEngine. If you
have your own app/models/user.rb file, you&#8217;ll need to include <a
href="../../../../classes/UserEngine/AuthorizedUser.html">UserEngine::AuthorizedUser</a>
in your file.

</li>
<li>The UserController#edit action has been overriden to know about Roles. See
user_engine/app/user_controller.rb for details.

</li>
<li>Many new methods for administrating users, roles and permissions have been
provided - again, see user_engine/app/user_controller.rb.

</li>
<li>If you have overridden any User views, look at the corresponding views in
the <a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a> to see if
there are any changes you wish to include in your own versions.

</li>
</ul>
<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>
A number of configuration parameters are available to allow to you control
how the data is stored, should you be unhappy with the defaults. These are
outlined below. You should almost certainly customize the
<tt>:admin_email</tt> value in your environment.rb file, i.e.:
</p>
<pre>
  module LoginEngine
    config :salt, 'your salt value'
  end
  module UserEngine
    config :admin_email, 'admin@megacorp.com'
  end
  Engines.start :login, :user
</pre>
<h3>Configuration Options</h3>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>role_table</tt>:</td><td>the name of the table to store Role objects in. Defaults to
&quot;roles&quot; (or &quot;role&quot; if you have disabled pluralization.)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>permission_table</tt>:</td><td>the name of the table to store Permission objects in. Defaults to
&quot;permissions&quot; (or &quot;permission&quot; if you have disabled
pluralization.)

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>user_role_table</tt>:</td><td>the join table for users and roles. Defaults to
&lt;user_table&gt;_&lt;role_table&gt;. (User table is specified in the
LoginEngine configuration).

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>permission_role_table</tt>:</td><td>the join table for roles and permissions. Defaults to
&lt;permission_table&gt;_&lt;role_table&gt;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>guest_role_name</tt>:</td><td>the name for the Guest Role. Defaults to &quot;Guest&quot;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>user_role_name</tt>:</td><td>the name for the User Role. Defaults to &quot;User&quot;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>admin_role_name</tt>:</td><td>the name for the Admin Role. Defaults to &quot;Admin&quot;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>admin_login</tt>:</td><td>the login ID for the initial Admin user. Defaults to &quot;admin&quot;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>admin_email</tt>:</td><td>the email address of the site administrator. Defaults to
&quot;admin@your.company&quot;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>login_page</tt>:</td><td>a Hash describing where the login page. Defaults to {:controller =&gt;
&#8216;user&#8217;, :action =&gt; &#8216;login&#8217;}

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>steath</tt>:</td><td>a boolean flag to indicate whether or not the system should display helpful
messages about authorized roles when they are denied access to an action,
or if it should simply deny the user access without revealing which roles
can access that action. Defaults to false (i.e. DO show helpful messages).

</td></tr>
</table>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<h3>Users</h3>
<p>
Once you have logged in as an administrator, you can go to /user/list to
get a list of all users. Here you can also create new users (/user/new) and
edit the details of the users in your system.
</p>
<p>
If you edit a user (/user/edit_user/<tt>id</tt>), you can now not only
change user details and passwords, but also specify which roles the user
has.
</p>
<h3>Roles</h3>
<p>
Three distinct Role objects are initially created when you bootstrap the <a
href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Guest, with permissions to login, signup and retrieve forgotten passwords

</li>
<li>User, with permissions to logout, to to /user/home, change passwords and
edit their own information

</li>
<li>Admin, with permissions to edit all users, list users, edit all roles, edit
permissions, and so on.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
New roles can easily be created at /role/new, where you can select exactly
which permissions this role should have. A similar interface is presented
in /role/edit/<tt>id</tt>. For instance, if you have a ReportController
with the actions <tt>view</tt> and <tt>edit</tt>, you might create two new
Roles - &#8216;ReportViewer&#8217; and ReportEditor&#8217;. The only
permissions the ReportViewer has will be report/view, and the only
permission assigned to ReportEditor is similarly report/edit. You can now
assign the ReportViewer role to as many users as will need to be able to
view reports, but only give the ReportEditor to users who should also be
able to edit reports.
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s worth noting that this point that if a user has the ability to
edit other users (/user/edit_user), they will be able to assign Roles
(including the Admin role) to anyone they please. Similarly, users who can
edit roles (/role/edit) can add any permissions at all to any Role within
the system. Therefore you (as the system administrator) must be <b>very</b>
careful about allowing these permissions on any role other than Admin.
</p>
<p>
In general, you should not give normal users <b>any</b> permissions other
than the default ones, and permissions to any controllers specific to
<b>your</b> application.
</p>
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>
While you can create permissions using the regular scaffold-style
interface, it is better to avoid manually creating them if possible.
Instead, a method is provided for automatically scanning your controllers
and ensuring that there exists a Permission object for each
controller-action pair. This method is
<tt>Permission.sychronize_controllers</tt> (or just
<tt>Permission.sync</tt> as a shorthand), and can be called either from the
console, or as a rake task:
</p>
<pre>
  rake sync_permissions
</pre>
<p>
It may be worth noting that currently this method will deliberately
<b>never</b> delete any permission objects from your system, even if the
method is no longer present.
</p>
<h2>Helper methods</h2>
<p>
The <a href="../../../../classes/UserEngine.html">UserEngine</a> provides
several helpers which understand permissions and roles, to be used in your
views. The two most important are outlined below.
</p>
<h3>link_if_authorized(controller, action)</h3>
<p>
<tt>link_if_authorized</tt> will produce a link to an action <b>only</b> if
the currently logged-in user has permission to perform the given action. It
can be passed options to show the text (without a link) if the user is not
authorized, or to wrap the text in another HTML element (i.e an li element)
if a link is to be produced.
</p>
<h3>authorized?(controller, action)</h3>
<p>
<tt>authorized?</tt> will simply return true or false to reflect the
current user&#8217;s authorization for the given action. This method can
also take a block, which will only be performed if the user is authorized
for the given action. In this manner you can control the display chunks of
HTML or certain processing based on the permissions of the current user.
</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<h3>Database Schemas &amp; Testing</h3>
<p>
Currently, since not all databases appear to support structure cloning, the
tests will load the entire schema into your test database, potentially
blowing away any other test structures you might have. If this presents an
issue for your application, comment out the line in test/test_helper.rb
