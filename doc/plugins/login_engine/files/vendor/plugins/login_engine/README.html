      <h1>Before we start</h1>
<p>
This is a Rails Engine version of the Salted Login Generator, a most
excellent login system which is sufficient for most simple cases. For the
most part, this code has not been altered from its generator form, with the
following notable exceptions
</p>
<ul>
<li>Localization has been removed.

</li>
<li>The &#8216;welcome&#8217; page has been changed to the &#8216;home&#8217;
page

</li>
<li>A few new functions have been thrown in

</li>
<li>It&#8217;s&#8230; uh.&#8230; a Rails Engine now ;-)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, what I&#8217;m trying to say is that 99.9999% of the credit for
this should go to Joe Hosteny, Tobias Luetke (xal) and the folks that
worked on the original Salted Login generator code. I&#8217;ve just wrapped
it into something runnable with the Rails Engine system.
</p>
<p>
Please also bear in mind that this is a work in progress, and things like
testing are wildly up in the air&#8230; but they will fall into place very
soon. And now, on with the show.
</p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
Installing the Login Engine is fairly simple.
</p>
<p>
Your options are:
</p>
<pre>
  1.  Install as a rails plugin:
      $ script/plugin install login_engine
  2.  Use svn:externals
      $ svn propedit svn:externals vendor/plugins

      You can choose to use the latest stable release:
          login_engine http://svn.rails-engines.org/plugins/login_engine

      Or a tagged release (recommended for releases of your code):
          login_engine http://svn.rails-engines.org/logine_engine/tags/&lt;TAGGED_RELEASE&gt;
</pre>
<p>
There are a few configuration steps that you&#8217;ll need to take to get
everything running smoothly. Listed below are the changes to your
application you will need to make.
</p>
<h3>Setup your Rails application</h3>
<p>
Edit your <tt>database.yml</tt>, most importantly! You might also want to
move <tt>public/index.html</tt> out of the way, and set up some default
routes in <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>.
</p>
<h3>Add configuration and start engine</h3>
<p>
Add the following to the bottom of environment.rb:
</p>
<pre>
  module LoginEngine
    config :salt, &quot;your-salt-here&quot;
  end

  Engines.start :login
</pre>
<p>
You&#8216;ll probably want to change the Salt value to something unique.
You can also override any of the configuration values defined at the top of
lib/user_system.rb in a similar way. Note that you don&#8217;t need to
start the engine with <tt>Engines.start :login_engine</tt> - instead,
<tt>:login</tt> (or any name) is sufficient if the engine is a directory
named &lt;some-name&gt;_engine.
</p>
<h3>Add the filters</h3>
<p>
Next, edit your <tt>app/controllers/application.rb</tt> file. The beginning
of your <tt>ApplicationController</tt> should look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'login_engine'

  class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
    include LoginEngine
    helper :user
    model :user

    before_filter :login_required
</pre>
<p>
If you don&#8217;t want ALL actions to require a login, you need to read
further below to learn how to restrict only certain actions.
</p>
<p>
Add the following to your ApplicationHelper:
</p>
<pre>
  module ApplicationHelper
    include LoginEngine
  end
</pre>
<p>
This ensures that the methods to work with users in your views are
available
</p>
<h3>Set up ActionMailer</h3>
<p>
If you want to disable email functions within the Login Engine, simple set
the :use_email_notification config flag to false in your environment.rb
file:
</p>
<pre>
  module LoginEngine

    #  ... other options...
    config :use_email_notification, false

  end
</pre>
<p>
You should note that retrieving forgotten passwords automatically
isn&#8217;t possible when the email functions are disabled. Instead, the
user is presented with a message instructing them to contact the system
administrator
</p>
<p>
If you wish you use email notifications and account creation verification,
you must properly configure ActionMailer for your mail settings. For
example, you could add the following in config/environments/development.rb
(for a .Mac account, and with your own username and password, obviously):
</p>
<p>
ActionMailer::Base.server_settings = {
</p>
<pre>
  :address =&gt; &quot;smtp.mac.com&quot;,
  :port =&gt; 25,
  :domain =&gt; &quot;smtp.mac.com&quot;,
  :user_name =&gt; &quot;&lt;your user name here&gt;&quot;,
  :password =&gt; &quot;&lt;your password here&gt;&quot;,
  :authentication =&gt; :login
</pre>
<p>
}
</p>
<p>
You&#8216;ll need to configure it properly so that email can be sent. One
of the easiest ways to test your configuration is to temporarily reraise
exceptions from the signup method (so that you get the actual mailer
exception string). In the rescue statement, put a single &quot;raise&quot;
statement in. Once you&#8217;ve debugged any setting problems, remove that
statement to get the proper flash error handling back.
</p>
<h3>Create the DB schema</h3>
<p>
After you have done the modifications the the ApplicationController and its
helper, you can import the user model into the database. An ActiveRecord
schema.rb file is provided in login_engine/db/schema.rb, along with
migration information in login_engine/db/migrate/.
</p>
<p>
You <b>MUST</b> check that these files aren&#8217;t going to interfere with
anything in your application.
</p>
<p>
You can change the table name used by adding
</p>
<pre>
  module LoginEngine

    #  ... other options...
    config :user_table, &quot;your_table_name&quot;

  end
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;to the <a
href="../../../../classes/LoginEngine.html">LoginEngine</a> configuration
in <tt>environment.rb</tt>. Then run from the root of your project:
</p>
<pre>
  rake engine_migrate ENGINE=login
</pre>
<p>
to import the schema into your database.
</p>
<h2>Include stylesheets</h2>
<p>
If you want the default stylesheet, add the following line to your layout:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;%= engine_stylesheet 'login_engine' %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230; somewhere in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML layout file.
</p>
<h2>Integrate flash messages into your layout</h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../../classes/LoginEngine.html">LoginEngine</a> does not
display any flash messages in the views it contains, and thus you must
display them yourself. This allows you to integrate any flash messages into
your existing layout. <a
href="../../../../classes/LoginEngine.html">LoginEngine</a> adheres to the
emerging flash usage standard, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>:warning - warning (failure) messages

</li>
<li>:notice - success messages

</li>
<li>:message - neutral (reminder, informational) messages

</li>
</ul>
<p>
This gives you the flexibility to theme the different message classes
separately. In your layout you should check for and display
flash[:warning], flash[:notice] and flash[:message]. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;% for name in [:notice, :warning, :message] %&gt;
    &lt;% if flash[name] %&gt;
      &lt;%= &quot;&lt;div id=\&quot;#{name}\&quot;&gt;#{flash[name]}&lt;/div&gt;&quot; %&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Alternately, you could look at using the flash helper plugin (available
from <a
href="https://opensvn.csie.org/traccgi/flash_helper_plugin/trac.cgi">opensvn.csie.org/traccgi/flash_helper_plugin/trac.cgi</a>/),
which supports the same naming convention.
</p>
<h1>How to use the Login Engine</h1>
<p>
Now you can go around and happily add &quot;before_filter
:login_required&quot; to the controllers which you would like to protect.
</p>
<p>
After integrating the login system with your rails application navigate to
your new controller&#8217;s signup method. There you can create a new
account. After you are done you should have a look at your DB. Your freshly
created user will be there but the password will be a sha1 hashed 40 digit
mess. I find this should be the minimum of security which every page
offering login &amp; password should give its customers. Now you can move
to one of those controllers which you protected with the before_filter
:login_required snippet. You will automatically be re-directed to your
freshly created login controller and you are asked for a password. After
entering valid account data you will be taken back to the controller which
you requested earlier. Simple huh?
</p>
<h3>Protection using <tt>before_filter</tt></h3>
<p>
Adding the line <tt>before_filter :login_required</tt> to your
<tt>app/controllers/application.rb</tt> file will protect <b>all</b> of
your applications methods, in every controller. If you only want to control
access to specific controllers, remove this line from
<tt>application.rb</tt> and add it to the controllers that you want to
secure.
</p>
<p>
Within individual controllers you can restrict which methods the filter
runs on in the usual way:
</p>
<pre>
       before_filter :login_required, :only =&gt; [:myaccount, :changepassword]
       before_filter :login_required, :except =&gt; [:index]
</pre>
<h3>Protection using <tt>protect?()</tt></h3>
<p>
Alternatively, you can leave the <tt>before_filter</tt> in the global
<tt>application.rb</tt> file, and control which actions are restricted in
individual controllers by defining a <tt>protect?()</tt> method in that
controller.
</p>
<p>
For instance, in the <tt>UserController</tt> we want to allow everyone
access to the &#8216;login&#8217;, &#8216;signup&#8217; and
&#8216;forgot_password&#8217; methods (otherwise noone would be able to
access our site!). So a <tt>protect?()</tt> method is defined in
<tt>user_controller.rb</tt> as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  def protect?(action)
    if ['login', 'signup', 'forgot_password'].include?(action)
      return false
    else
      return true
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
Of course, you can override this Engine behaviour in your application - see
below.
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
The following configuration variables are set in lib/login_engine.rb. If
you wish to override them, you should set them BEFORE calling Engines.start
(it is possible to set them after, but it&#8217;s simpler to just do it
before. Please refer to the Engine documentation for the config method for
more information).
</p>
<p>
For example, the following might appear at the bottom of
/config/environment.rb:
</p>
<pre>
  module LoginEngine
    config :salt, 'my salt'
    config :app_name, 'My Great App'
    config :app_url, 'http://www.wow-great-domain.com'
  end

  Engines.start
</pre>
<h3>Configuration Options</h3>
<table>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>email_from</tt>:</td><td>The email from which registration/administration emails will appear to come
from. Defaults to &#8216;webmaster@your.company&#8217;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>admin_email</tt>:</td><td>The email address users are prompted to contact if passwords cannot be
emailed. Defaults to &#8216;webmaster@your.company&#8217;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>app_url</tt>:</td><td>The URL of the site sent to users for signup/forgotten passwords, etc.
Defaults to &#8216;<a
href="http://localhost:3000">localhost:3000</a>/&#8217;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>app_name</tt>:</td><td>The application title used in emails. Defaults to &#8216;TestApp&#8217;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>mail_charset</tt>:</td><td>The charset used in emails. Defaults to &#8216;utf-8&#8217;.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>security_token_life_hours</tt>:</td><td>The life span of security tokens, in hours. If a security token is older
than this when it is used to try and authenticate a user, it will be
discarded. In other words, the amount of time new users have between
signing up and clicking the link they are sent. Defaults to 24 hours.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>two_column_input</tt>:</td><td>If true, forms created with the UserHelper#form_input method will use a
two-column table. Defaults to true.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>changeable_fields</tt>:</td><td>An array of fields within the user model which the user is allowed to edit.
The Salted Hash Login generator documentation states that you should NOT
include the email field in this array, although I am not sure why. Defaults
to +[ &#8216;firstname&#8217;, &#8216;lastname&#8217; ]+.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>delayed_delete</tt>:</td><td>Set to true to allow delayed deletes (i.e., delete of record doesn&#8217;t
happen immediately after user selects delete account, but rather after some
expiration of time to allow this action to be reverted). Defaults to false.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>delayed_delete_days</tt>:</td><td>The time delay used for the &#8216;delayed_delete&#8217; feature. Defaults
to 7 days.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>user_table</tt>:</td><td>The table to store User objects in. Defaults to &quot;users&quot; (or
&quot;user&quot; if ActiveRecord pluralization is disabled).

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>use_email_notification</tt>:</td><td>If false, no emails will be sent to the user. As a consequence, users who
signup are immediately verified, and they cannot request forgotten
passwords. Defaults to true.

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><tt>confirm_account</tt>:</td><td>An overriding flag to control whether or not user accounts must be verified
by email. This overrides the <tt>user_email_notification</tt> flag.
Defaults to true.

</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Overriding controllers and views</h2>
<p>
The standard home page is almost certainly not what you want to present to
your users. Because this login system is a Rails Engine, overriding the
default behaviour couldn&#8217;t be simpler. To change the RHTML template
shown for the <tt>home</tt> action, simple create a new file in
<tt>RAILS_ROOT/app/views/user/home.rhtml</tt> (you&#8217;ll probably need
to create the directory <tt>user</tt> at the same time). This new view file
will be used instead of the one provided in the Login Engine. Easy!
</p>
<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
<p>
How do I&#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  ... access the user who is currently logged in

  A: You can get the user object from the session using session[:user]
     Example:
       Welcome &lt;%= session[:user].name %&gt;

    You can also use the 'current_user' method provided by UserHelper:
    Example:
      Welcome &lt;%= current_user.name %&gt;

  ... restrict access to only a few methods?

  A: Use before_filters build in scoping.
     Example:
       before_filter :login_required, :only =&gt; [:myaccount, :changepassword]
       before_filter :login_required, :except =&gt; [:index]

  ... check if a user is logged-in in my views?

  A: session[:user] will tell you. Here is an example helper which you can use to make this more pretty:
     Example:
       def user?
         !session[:user].nil?
       end

  ... return a user to the page they came from before logging in?

  A: The user will be send back to the last url which called the method &quot;store_location&quot;
     Example:
       User was at /articles/show/1, wants to log in.
       in articles_controller.rb, add store_location to the show function and
       send the user to the login form.
       After he logs in he will be send back to /articles/show/1
</pre>

href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/SaltedLoginGenerator">wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/SaltedLoginGenerator</a>
</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>
One of the more common problems people have seen is that after verifying an
account by following the emailed URL, they are unable to login via the
normal login method since the verified field is not properly set in the
user model&#8217;s row in the DB.
</p>
<p>
The most common cause of this problem is that the DB and session get out of
sync. In particular, it always happens for me after recreating the DB if I
have run the server previously. To fix the problem, remove the /tmp/ruby*
session files (from wherever they are for your installation) while the
server is stopped, and then restart. This usually is the cause of the
problem.
</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<h3>Database Schemas &amp; Testing</h3>
<p>
Currently, since not all databases appear to support structure cloning, the
tests will load the entire schema into your test database, potentially
blowing away any other test structures you might have. If this presents an
issue for your application, comment out the line in test/test_helper.rb
</p>
<h1>Database Schema Details</h1>
<p>
You need a database table corresponding to the User model. This is provided
as a Rails Schema file, but the schema is presented below for information.
Note the table type for MySQL. Whatever DB you use, it must support
transactions. If it does not, the functional tests will not work properly,
nor will the application in the face of failures during certain DB creates
and updates.
</p>
<pre>
  mysql syntax:
  CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    login VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
    salted_password VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    firstname VARCHAR(40),
    lastname VARCHAR(40),
    salt CHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    verified INT default 0,
    role VARCHAR(40) default NULL,
    security_token CHAR(40) default NULL,
    token_expiry DATETIME default NULL,
    deleted INT default 0,
    delete_after DATETIME default NULL
  ) TYPE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

  postgres:
  CREATE TABLE &quot;users&quot; (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
    login VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
    salted_password VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    firstname VARCHAR(40),
    lastname VARCHAR(40),
    salt CHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    verified INT default 0,
    role VARCHAR(40) default NULL,
    security_token CHAR(40) default NULL,
    token_expiry TIMESTAMP default NULL,
    deleted INT default 0,
    delete_after TIMESTAMP default NULL
  ) WITH OIDS;

  sqlite:
  CREATE TABLE 'users' (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    login VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
    salted_password VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    firstname VARCHAR(40),
    lastname VARCHAR(40),
    salt CHAR(40) NOT NULL,
    verified INT default 0,
    role VARCHAR(40) default NULL,
    security_token CHAR(40) default NULL,
    token_expiry DATETIME default NULL,
    deleted INT default 0,
    delete_after DATETIME default NULL
  );
</pre>
<p>
Of course your user model can have any amount of extra fields. This is just
a starting point.
