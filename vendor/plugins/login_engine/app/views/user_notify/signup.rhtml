What Is PopCurrent?

PopCurrent is a new way for cool stuff to get noticed. 
 
It works democratically, by giving everyone the power to be a critic.  Imagine something like  'Entertainment Weekly' -- but where everyone is an editor with equal say.
 
Muscians, podcasters, video producers, photographers, indy book authors and other online media creators submit their work (or you can submit something you think is cool: it doesn't have to be yours.  You're an editor, remember? :) ). 
 
Exactly what are these entries?  Well, they might be a MySpace band page, or a YouTube video, or a set of Flickr photos, or a Podcast episode, or a podiobook or print-on-demand book.  As long as it's online media, it's permitted.  Once submitted, these entries appear publicly in the 'New Entries' section.  Then, everyone can 'Pop' (vote up) or 'Flop' (vote down) these entries.  An entry that gets enough Pops is promoted to the front page (This is very good, as that entry will now get a lot more traffic!) 
 
With millions of bands and videos online, and hundreds of thousands of podcasts and indy books, it's hard to sift through it all to find great stuff.  The next Beatles or Howard Stern or Stephen King are somewhere online right now: PopCurrent provides a way for them to get noticed.
